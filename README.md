## Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former English teacher turned perpetual student of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

### What's New?

#### Rust and The Command Line

In my most recent project, [maze-tui](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/maze-tui), I explored how to stretch the capabilities of the terminal to create beautiful visualizations of common maze building and graph searching algorithms. With the help of [ratatui.rs](https://github.com/ratatui-org), I was able to realize my vision of interesting and unique algorithm visualizations in the somewhat constrained environment of the Terminal User Interface. Also, the maintainers for ratatui.rs were very helpful in guiding me towards best practices with their library in the Discussion section of their repository. Go check them out! Feel free to see the original inspiration for this rust project, the [C++](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/multithreading-with-mazes) version, that started it all even though it is not as feature-rich as the rust version.

Another project on my radar is the [helix-editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix). After using Neovim for a few years, I learned of the helix editor project while starting my Rust learning journey. In fact, when I read that helix based their tui library off of the precursor to [ratatui.rs](https://github.com/ratatui-org), [tui.rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs), I used my [maze-tui](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/maze-tui) project as an opportunity to learn about what tui development was all about. I'm hooked! I will keep an eye on this project as I continue to use it, looking for opportunities to contribute where I can.

### What's Old?

#### Algorithm Exploration

I also enjoy taking a deep dive into new and challenging algorithms and tweaking their core ideas to apply to new and interesting problems. That is what [dancing-links](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/dancing-links) and [dancing-links-and-planning-pokemon](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/dancing-links-and-planning-pokemon) are all about. What started as Stanford University assignments regarding recursion, vertex covers, and independent sets, turned into a deep dive into how I could efficiently solve computationally difficult problems. This led me to connect Donald Knuth's [Dancing Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) algorithm to a wide variety of cover problems, even applying it to a beloved video game from my childhood. These projects are written in C++ and am currently working on big changes for [dancing-links-and-planning-pokemon](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/dancing-links-and-planning-pokemon), using it as an opportunity to learn about the relatively new WebGPU API and the not so new OpenGL.

#### Low Level Principles

![rb-tree-collage](/images/rb-tree-collage.png)

I don't often have to consider which heap allocator is operating from behind the scenes of the programming languages I use every day. With modern C++ practices and languages such as Rust, even the direct management of the heap through `new` and `free` mechanisms is becoming a thing of the past. However, it is always good to know what is happening a few layers beneath any abstraction we are using, when practical. So, following the notorious Stanford University CS107 Heap Allocator assignment, I wanted to know more about *how* we can make an allocator flexible, efficient, fast, or any combination of these traits. I implemented eight different heap allocators in C and through the use of programs targeted at understanding their performance characteristics wrote an extensive runtime analysis. Five of these allocators are variations on a Red Black Tree allocator. I chose these implementations as they were just *slightly* beyond my skill level to understand and implement at the time and I came away with great understanding of the costs and tradeoffs for heap implementations. Unfortunately, some of those implementations could help current Stanford students complete their Heap Allocator assignments so I am keeping this repository private though I am happy to share the repository and details upon request. I will leave you with an image I made for this repo and you can guess what it represents!

#### TCP

In the spring of 2023 I learned that there are at least two types of full stack engineers. The lesser known of the two is the TCP stack engineer! At least, that is the running joke for CS144 at Stanford University where we implement a comprehensive version of the TCP Network protocol bottom to top; starting with the byte stream and ending with a peer to peer connection, we were left with vague specifications and limitless freedom in implementing the various layers of the TCP stack, specifically tied to IPV4 for simplicity. The implementation and design principles I learned from this course were invaluable. I won the end of quarter competition for most performant Reassembler and my net ByteStream/Reassembler performance was second behind the course staff! Again, Stanford University requests we keep our solution private, but the repository we worked from is [available publicly every year](https://github.com/CS144/minnow). Feel free to check it out and I'm happy to share my work upon request. Here is a teaser of a TCPReceiver/Reassembler diagram from my writeup on that section of the course.

### What's Next?

#### A Deep Dive on Operating Systems

By far my favorite learning opportunities from Stanford University have come out of their systems track classes. The course offerings in this track are varied, rigorous, and well organized. Next in this sequence for me is an opportunity to implement a small operating system over the course of a quarter and I can't wait to get started!
